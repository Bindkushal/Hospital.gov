When the website opens, it will prompt the user with two pop-ups: one for location and one for preferred language.

In the background, there will be an AI chatbot nurse, using Gemini or the ChatGPT API if possible, until we develop our own AI nurse.

On the second page, there will be a sliding list of nearby hospitals.

The header will include the following sections: Home, Services, What's New Nearby, and Location of Hospitals.
